Located in Villafranca del Castillo, 30 minutes from Madrid, the ESAC scientific complex is a wonderful place where many different nationalities meet to improve our understanding of the cosmos. Today was BeppiColomb day! A day to celebrate the successful launch of the satellite of the same name that is gonna investigate Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun. It was a perfect opportunity to discover fun facts about the mission, follow conferences by the involved scientists and discuss directly with them about the challenges and solutions.

At ESAC I am a temporary trainee working for a few months on an open source solver for global astronometry. You can check it up with the buttons on top of the post or directly [here](https://github.com/bombrun/GaiaLab).
