Here a small description of the projects is provided as well as (when applicable) links to the code. In the github repositories you should easily find the pdf reports as well.

### StaySafeGeneva (Data Analysis)
Project of data analysis that investigate an improvement of google maps in which we also take into account the risk of a given road/itinerary. Project presented at the Applied Machine Learning Days 2018, Lausanne.
Project done in group of 3 as part of the Applied Data Analysis course of EPFL, 2017.
### GetInVolvo - StartHack 2018
Project of **Augmented Reality** (developed an app) that gave us the **3rd overall position** at the StartHack 2018 in Saint-Gallen. It was merely an application of existing open source library that we combined together. I pitched the project twice (once only with judges and once with judges + jury)
Other than me three other persons were part of the project: Ondine Chanon, Martino Milani, Charles Dufour.
### Road Segmentation (Machine Learning)
Project of Machine learning consisting of identifying roads from aerial images.
Project done in group of 3 as part of the Machine Learning course of EPFL, 2017.
### Darcy Flow (Numerical Analysis)
Analysis of the well-posedness and stability of Raviart-Thomas elements by an example of source pollution in a water reservoir modeled by the Darcy equations.
Project for Numerical methods for saddle points problems of EPFL, 2018.
### EEG classification (Deep Learning)
Project of Deep Learning consisting in classifying EEG signals to predict a left/right movement.
Project done in group of 3 as part of the Deep Learning course of EPFL, 2017.
### POD HiMod (ongoing in private repository)
Project of Numerical Analysis consisting in investigating a new approach for fluid simulation into veins and arteries. Here the idea is to model a venal bifurcation in which the entering and exiting branches are modeled by **HIerarchical MODal reduction** and the bifurcation itself by standard finite elements using **Principal Orthogonal Decomposition**. The code is written in c++ (HiMod) and matlab (POD).
Project done for the PACS course of Polimi in collaboration with Andrea Zanoni and using availables libraries such as LifeV and redbkit.



##### Disclaimer
The projects have often been made as part of groups and as such the credits should go to all groups members. I tried to always include all the names, but in case I forgot, please tell me!
