## Week 3 (04/03 - 08/02)
* WE --> StartHack

* Thursday
  * Morning --> IP (Image Processing)
  * numpy2vtk function and visualize firsts results
* Wednesday
  * catch up IP
  * NDA agreement
* Tuesday
  * Made the net work
* Monday
  * Made net work on toy data and trying to make it work on real data






## Week 2 (25/02 - 01/03)
* WE --> France
* Friday:
  * Have a non-working neural-net on the graph
  * not working but will repair it Monday
* Thursday:
  * Went to Reinforcement Learning
  * Start writing the net & prepare the data to be fed to the net --> did SVM to do a baseline
  * ~See Andrea for numerical problems~ worked late + Auriane instead  

How to coarsen the graph?
  1. Michael's methods changes the nodes :'(
  2. Sequentially with numpy? (it is a bit aleatoric...)
  3. Random (--> bad idea?)
  4. Do we really care? at the end its still a graph...
  5. How to coarsen the surface itself?



In the following A is the weighted Adjacency matrix (i.e. W in some notations)
$$
a_{ij}=exp(\frac{-||x_i-x_j||^2_2}{\sigma^2})\\
x'=GCN(A,X)=\sigma(A'XW)
L(Y,Y^\^)=||Y-Y^\^||^2_2 + Y^TLY
$$

* Wednesday:
  * Received email from Numeca & tried to get started installing Fine/OpenLabs
* Tuesday:
  * Read the data as .npy
  * moved the code on the server
  * Finished fine-tuning of vim
* Monday:
  * Extracted VTK data
  * got started with vim
## Week 1 (18/02 - 22/02)
* Checked the code pygsp and cnn_graps
* read some papers
  * Name the papers
* Before I did a presentation on numerical methods for PDE's with a focus on CFD
