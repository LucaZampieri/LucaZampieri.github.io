subtitle: Geometric Deep Learning for Computational Fluid Dynamics

---
This master thesis explores ways to apply geometric deep learning to
the field of numerical simulations with an emphasis on the Navier-Stokes
 equations. With the recent success of Deep Learning, there should be
  room for experimentation also in the field of fluid simulations.
  Here we lead such an experiment. We propose an end-to-end differentiable
  architecture that allow object-to-mesh predictions of fluid simulations.
  We provide a comparison with a baseline and visual results on three different
  datasets: airfoils, backward-facing steps and winged-drones.

  Once we got all x-velocity and y-velocity we wan also predict the
  recirculation zone behind the step, as we illustrate below.
  In the figure we show the simulation [left], and prediction [right].

Of course, the same process can be repeated to other other fields
 that can be and other problems. Here below, we can see the turbulent viscosity
 around a 2D airfoil:
