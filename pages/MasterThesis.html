This master thesis explores ways to apply geometric deep learning to
the field of numerical simulations with an emphasis on the Navier-Stokes
 equations. With the recent success of Deep Learning, there should be
  room for experimentation also in the field of fluid simulations.
  Here we lead such an experiment. We propose an end-to-end differentiable
  architecture that allow object-to-mesh predictions of fluid simulations.
  We provide a comparison with a baseline and visual results on three different
  datasets: airfoils, backward-facing steps and winged-drones.

          We desire to predict the fields around an object such as velocity and
          pressure given its
          mesh, and thus getting a direct relation between the mesh and the
          predicted fields.

  Here such a model has been built, leveraging geometric deep learning, i.e.
  deep learning on irregular domains, on which standard convolutions would
  fail. As a proof-of-concept we will present here only the results around the
   <a href="https://bfs.com">backward-facing-step</a>.
  The interested reader is invited to visit the
  <a href="https://thesis.com">thesis itself</a> for more details and
  different setups.

  The backward facing step is an important milestone in showing result in
  computational fluid dynamics as it has a simple geometry that hides a complex
  phenomena: the recirculation zone [see next paragraph]. Our model is able
  to predict the internal flow around the backward-facing-step
  as visually shown here below, with first prediction, the groundtruth and finally
  the absolute point-wise error. We emphatise that the prediction was made
  mesh-to-mesh, with as additional information the boundary conditions and properties
  of the flow (e.g. viscosity).

  Once we got all x-velocity and y-velocity we wan also predict the
  recirculation zone behind the step, as we illustrate below.
  In the figure we show the simulation [left], and prediction [right].

  As we see, the predicted solution (right) seems unfeasible with some
  streamlines seemingly exiting the side of the step... And indeed it is
  infeasible! This is because the conservation of mass has not been enforced
  by the model. To correct this behaviour, we can add a penalisation term in the
  loss of the network or iterate one through the domain to correct the
  conservation.

<p>
Of course, the same process can be repeated to other other fields
 that can be and other problems. Here below, we can see the turbulent viscosity
 on the airfoil dataset:

<p>
  Application of such an application can range computer graphics to the
  automatic design of engineering shapes. However, one application that we is
  dear to me would be to combine this prediction to the more accurate numerical
  simulation. An example is to initialize an iterative solver with a corrected
  prediction, hence (hopefully) drastically decreasing the number of iterations
  necessary to reach convergence.

  I hope to have captivated your attention and convinced you that there is
  something here that could be used in the future.
