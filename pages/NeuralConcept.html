<b> Neural concept </b> was wondering how its technology could be applied to different
applications. Our trainee explored such an application: <b>the  generalization to
volumetric fields predictions</b>.
</p>

The desired outcome of the project can be expressed in the following way:
<div class="container-fluid"> <!-- If Needed Left and Right Padding in 'md' and 'lg' screen means use container class -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-8 col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
        <p>
          We desire to predict the fields around an object such as velocity and
          pressure given its
          mesh, and thus getting a direct relation between the mesh and the
          predicted fields.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">

      </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
  Such a model has been built, leveraging geometric deep learning, i.e.
  deep learning on irregular domains, on which standard convolutions would
  fail. As a proof-of-concept we will present here only the results around a
   <b>backward-facing-step</b> and a 2D airfoil, but are easily generalized to
   complex 3D flows as our applications will show.
</p>
<p>
  The backward facing step is an important milestone for showing result in
  computational fluid dynamics as it has a simple geometry that hides a complex
  phenomena: the re-circulation zone [see next paragraph]. Our model is able
  to predict the internal flow around the backward-facing-step
  as visually shown here below, with first prediction, then groundtruth and finally
  the absolute point-wise error. We emphatise that the prediction was made
  mesh-to-mesh, with as additional information only the boundary conditions and properties
  of the flow (e.g. viscosity).

<p> Pressure: </p>

<p>
  Once we got all x-velocity and y-velocity we can also predict the
  re-circulation zone behind the step, as we illustrate below.
  In the figure we show the simulation [left], and prediction [right].

<div class="container-fluid"> <!-- If Needed Left and Right Padding in 'md' and 'lg' screen means use container class -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
        <img src="../../img/my_GT.png" alt="vortex-gt" align="right" class="img-rounded"/>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
        <img src="../../img/my_pred.png" alt="vortex-pred" align="right" class="img-rounded"/>
      </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
  As we see, the predicted solution (right) seems unfeasible with some
  streamlines seemingly exiting the side of the step... And indeed, it is
  infeasible! It does not satisfy the conservation of mass, as it has not been enforced
  by the model. To correct this behavior, we can add a penalization term in the
  loss of the network or iterate one step through the domain correcting the
  conservation.
</p>


<p>
Of course, the same process can be repeated to other fields
 that can be of interest for numerical simulations or other problems. Here below, we can see the turbulent viscosity
 on the airfoil dataset:

<p>
  Application of such a model can range from computer graphics to the
  automatic design of engineering shapes. However, one application that we is
  dear to the trainee would be to combine this prediction to the more accurate numerical
  simulations. An example is to initialize an iterative solver with a corrected
  prediction, hence (hopefully) drastically decreasing the number of iterations
  necessary to reach convergence, and with it the computational cost.
</p>
<p>
  Stay tuned for more advances on this direction!
